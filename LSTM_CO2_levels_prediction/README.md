# **$CO_2$ levels prediction**

$CO_2$ levels in the air change in time and space. 
The CO2 values affect many environmental factors and are affected, among other things, by vegetation, emissions from cars or industry, etc.
While other environmental data is available almost everywhere, $CO_2$ data requires more expensive sensors and is often not available everywhere.

In this model I will try to predict the levels of $CO_2$ in the air based on radiation, temperature and relative humidity data collected using precise sensors.
Since these climatic factors directly affect the photosynthesis rate of the plants, I assume that they have some correlation to the CO2 levels in the atmosphere.
