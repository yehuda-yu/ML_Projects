# **$CO_2$ levels prediction**

The levels of $CO_2$ in the atmosphere fluctuate with time and location, influenced by various factors such as vegetation and industrial/vehicular emissions. While other environmental data is widely accessible, $CO_2$ measurements often require costly sensors and may not be readily available.

This project aims to predict $CO_2$ concentrations in the air through the use of temperature, radiation, and relative humidity data gathered from precise sensors. These climate variables directly impact the rate of photosynthesis in plants, hence I hypothesize that they have a correlation with the $CO_2$ levels in the atmosphere.
